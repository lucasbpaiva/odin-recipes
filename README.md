This is my first project using plain html. I constructed this to practice the general structure of html documents, links and images. 

Being my first project it also serves as a means of practicing the git and github workflow: creating a repository, cloning it to my local machine, creating and modifying files, writing commit messages about those modifications and pushing changes to the remote.

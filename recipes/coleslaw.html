    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic, staple side dish, coleslaw is a must for summer BBQs, potlucks, and picnics. Everyone needs a go-to recipe, and I happen to think this is the one you should reach for. With its mix of purple and green cabbage, it's a winner on looks alone. But the kicker is the dressing, which is lighter and punchier than other coleslaw dressings thanks to a generous amount of apple cider vinegar and Dijon mustard. Whether you're hungry for a last-minute side dish or the perfect topping to your meal (we're looking at you, chicken burgers), this coleslaw recipe has you covered.</p>

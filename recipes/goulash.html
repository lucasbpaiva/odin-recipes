    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic nostalgic comfort dish, goulash is the hearty weeknight dinner I'll always crave. The best thing about this goulash recipe? Everything cooks together in one pot—even the pasta! Cooking the macaroni directly in the goulash means the pasta gets to soak up all that beef and tomato flavor while simultaneously releasing some of its starch into the pan, thickening the goulash to create a hearty, comforting stew. Trust me—once you cook pasta this way, you'll never go back to boiling water again. Read on for all of my tips and tricks for making this staple cozy meal.</p>
